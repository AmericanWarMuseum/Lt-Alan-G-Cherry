Lt. Alan G. Cherry: A Comprehensive Biography
Early Life and Education
Lieutenant Alan George Cherry was born on March 12, 1891, in Worcester, Massachusetts, to a family deeply rooted in the values of hard work, education, and public service. He grew up in a modest household, with his father working as a civil engineer and his mother overseeing the family’s well-being. Worcester, a bustling industrial city, exposed young Alan to the advancements in technology and engineering that would later shape his career.

From an early age, Alan displayed an affinity for problem-solving and a natural curiosity about the mechanics of the world around him. He excelled in mathematics and the sciences during his school years, which earned him a place at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), one of the most prestigious engineering schools in the country. There, he pursued a degree in civil engineering, focusing on infrastructure projects that would later prove invaluable during his military service.

Alan was an active member of the Theta Chi Fraternity, which instilled in him the principles of leadership, camaraderie, and service to the nation. He graduated in 1913, at the height of a period of rapid industrialization and just as tensions in Europe were beginning to escalate.

Military Preparation and Training
As war loomed on the horizon, Alan Cherry felt a patriotic duty to serve his country. In 1916, he attended the Plattsburg Businessmen’s Training Camp in New York, part of the Preparedness Movement that sought to ready the nation’s future officers for an inevitable conflict in Europe. The camp brought together men from various professional backgrounds—bankers, lawyers, and engineers like Cherry—to undergo rigorous military training.

At Plattsburg, Cherry learned the fundamentals of military discipline, leadership, and battlefield engineering. He demonstrated exceptional organizational skills and a strong moral compass, traits that led to his commission as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1917.

Commission and Deployment
In August 1917, Lt. Cherry received orders to join the newly formed 301st Engineer Regiment, part of the 78th Division of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF). The regiment was activated at Camp Devens, Massachusetts, where Cherry and his fellow officers began the daunting task of transforming civilians into combat-ready soldiers.

The men endured harsh conditions at Camp Devens, particularly during the winter of 1917-1918, when temperatures plummeted to minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit. Despite the cold, Cherry’s regiment trained tirelessly in trench construction, bridge building, and the use of explosives—all essential skills for battlefield engineers.

Before departing for France, the men of the 301st received vaccinations for smallpox and typhoid, as required by the War Department. These vaccinations were critical in preventing disease outbreaks during the regiment's overseas deployment.

The Journey to France
On July 14, 1918, Lt. Cherry and the 301st Engineers boarded the SS Katoomba, an Australian coastwise steamer converted into a troop transport. The Atlantic crossing was fraught with danger, as German U-boats prowled the waters. Cherry described the journey as both exhilarating and nerve-wracking, with soldiers oscillating between the fear of sinking and the reality of seasickness.

Upon arrival in Brest, France, the regiment was greeted by the war-weary French population. Cherry recalled the devastation he witnessed in the countryside—bombed-out villages, rows of wooden crosses marking soldiers' graves, and the ever-present sound of artillery in the distance.

The regiment was soon deployed to St. Amand, where they established their headquarters and began building roads, railways, and supply depots. The 301st Engineers played a critical role in maintaining the infrastructure needed to support the advancing American forces.

The St. Mihiel Offensive
The St. Mihiel Offensive, launched in September 1918, marked the first major American-led assault of the war. Lt. Cherry’s regiment was tasked with ensuring that supply lines remained open by building pontoon bridges, repairing bomb-damaged roads, and clearing mud-choked paths under enemy fire.

Cherry described the offensive as a turning point in the war and a defining moment in his military career. He and his men worked tirelessly, often under bombardment, to keep the Flirey-Essey road open. Despite the mud, rain, and exhaustion, the engineers knew that their work was essential to the success of the operation.

The March into Germany
Following the signing of the Armistice on November 11, 1918, the 301st Engineers joined the Army of Occupation and began their march into Germany. Cherry’s regiment crossed the Rhine River at Remagen, a significant moment in the post-war occupation. The Germans, defeated and weary, watched the Americans with a mix of curiosity and apprehension.

Cherry was stationed in Brohl, a town along the Rhine, where his regiment took charge of rebuilding infrastructure and maintaining order. The engineers constructed bridges, repaired railways, and ensured that the local population complied with occupation policies.

One of Cherry’s most vivid memories from this period was the Christmas of 1918. The regiment organized a Christmas Eve celebration with trees, decorations, and gifts for the men. The highlight of the evening was a performance by Army Nurses, whose presence brought a touch of home to the soldiers so far from their families.

Post-War Reflections and Legacy
Lt. Cherry returned to the United States in 1919, carrying with him the memories of a war that had changed the world—and himself—forever. He resumed his career as a civil engineer, applying the skills and lessons he had learned during the war to peacetime projects.

Cherry remained active in veterans' organizations, attending reunions of the 301st Engineers and contributing to publications that preserved the history of his regiment. He often reflected on the importance of leadership and the bonds formed during the war, noting that the men who served under him were more than soldiers—they were brothers.

Cherry’s Colt .45 pistol, inscribed with his name, remained a treasured possession—a reminder of the comrades he had lost and the resilience they had shown. His story, like those of many World War I veterans, serves as a testament to the sacrifices made by a generation that believed in duty, honor, and service to country.
