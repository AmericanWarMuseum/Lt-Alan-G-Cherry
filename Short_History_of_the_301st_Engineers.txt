Chapter I Camp Devens . By Capt. Arthur W. Waldron.

"To the 301st Engineers-Assigned."
The officers will all remember the thrills experienced when their orders were issued and how fortunate they were considered by those
"attached."
They rode from Boston that memorable day in August on their never to be forgotten friend the B. & M. and reported, it will be remembered two days ahead of time, which was a great disappointment to most of them for they needs must return to two more full days of riotous living in Boston or nearby towns.
The 301st Engineers became a fact on September 1st 1917 when the officers reported to their then Commanding Officer, Col. Francis A.
Pope. Attached to the regiment from the training camp were a number of officers who were with it for some weeks, attached to the different companies as assistant instructors. This brought up the officer personnel to nearly double its rated quota, but as the oportunity presented itself and the exigencies of the Service called for more and more trained officers the "attached" men gradually left the regiment for other fields. Some were of course highly specialized, as was Captain, later Major Moore; who became a factor in bridge design for the A. E. F. Many went to the National Guard divisions, some to the new National Army outfits, which were at that time under training, but wherever they went, coupled with the close bond of fellowship bred of the old days at Belvoir, these men will always have an interest in the 301st and it in them for now all "have reached their objective" and share the glorious victory.
All the officers detailed to the so called "Conscription Troops" possessed to a greater or less degree the feeling that the strong arm would of necessity be the only method of handling the expectant incorrigibles but they did not have long to think it over nor to prepare. On September 5 rolled into their camp the first five per cent of Rhode Island's contingent, Happily their expectations were not realized for to them came as fine a lot of men as Rhode Island could produce. All were picked men with no semblance as yet, it is true of their soldierly qualities, for a man never looks a soldier in "cits". These men were assigned to "D" Company where a nucleus was established for additional troops in the regiment.
They numbered about 100 men. Several have been commissioned and well reported althougt lost to the 301st, and, of the others, nearly all have
become high ranking "non-coms" in staff or line.
All through September and October "Rhode Island's finest" continued to pour in until in the early part of November the organization was practically to strength. Officered and equipped, they were beginning to make something of a showing.
About November 1st the live stock (horses and mules) with perhaps four McClellan saddles and a whiffletree or two. It was then through "horse exercises" the regiment developed its far famed broncho busting tendencies and several of the officers, as well as the men, after they left the hospital attested to their success along these lines.
Now came the inauguration of schools, both for enlisted men and officers. They were under the supervision of the commanding officer and instructed by members of the officer personnel, assisted by the French Commission. Practical work was undertaken and valuable instruction given not only to the regiment but to the whole 76th Division in trench construction, shelters, wiring, mining, demolition etc.
Winter at Camp Devens was not conducive to tropical pursuits and the regiment will remember with awe the days and nights from December 1st until spring when at times the thermometer dropped to minus 30 degrees and lower; when barracks and especially officers' quarters before steam was installed, resembled nothing so much as cold, very colo, storage plants. The spirit of the times was with the men, however, and in spite of colo, hard work, and sometimes hunger (for at that time the far famed quartermaster cooks and mess sergeants schools were in vogue), the 301 st always came up smiling and ready for another try.
By December 1st it had become a well disciplined, well organized and most efficient engineer regiment, not only in its own particular line of work but presented a very creditable appearance as line troops. On December 1st the regiment went to Providence, the capital of Rhode Island, was reviewed and impressed the State very favorably.
About that time the entire regiment of the 14th Railway Engineers was attached to the 301st. Their personnel was without officers or noncommissioned officers and the 301st was commissioned with the training and equipment of those troops for overseas service. In a month, with credit to all concerned, the 141h Engineers left for France and their record at Cambrai was one of which any organization might be proud.
Just before Christmas, evil times fell upon the 301st in that some: one in high command had "looked upon it and found it good" and had decided that there were not one but several excellent men in the regi-ment. Forthwith it was shot to pieces, losing a great many of its carefully trained and efficient men to other organizations. However, throughout the long winter days the men drilled, hiked, dug, studied and played.
Nothing daunted by their fast disappearing ranks they continued to perfect themselves in spite of "Details". The Soldiers Club had by that time been established at Robbins Pond and that, with the Liberty Theatre and the Y.M.C.A.s gave both the enlisted men and officers plenty of enfertainment.
Came, too, their succesful regimental dances and the inauguration of the 301 st Engineer Band which as they had become a respectable and knee. high regiment, they were properly rated by the War Departement.
Early spring found them very much "on the job" and expectant of better things than garrison duty for there had been vague whisperings of an early departure for France, but up to that time nothing had materia. lized. Competitive drill, bridge building, range working and increased activity in hikes (with full equipment now including the much prized rolling stock) began to be the order of the day. Increased activities in field fortifications were also to be noticed. Colonel Pope at this time left the regiment for awhile through illness and shortly after, Lieut. Col. Downing, the second in command, was promoted to colonel and transferred. Major.
Cassidy, a new acquisition to the personnel, became the commanding officer.
As the snow left and spring advanced, Pine fielo was cleared and now the regiment had a real parade where daily programs of drill and ceremonies were carried on with great satisfaction. The regiment was at that time presented with the regimental colors and lacked only the necessary men. With the coming of spring, athletics began to play a prominent part in the regiment. Field days, ball games, all out of door sports were encouraged and in addition to the daily routine of drill, interesting features such as regimental setting up exercises, equitation, etc, were introduced. tennis courts for the officers were laid out and constructed and the camp began to take on the appearance of a permanent garrison.
The next event of importance came in the late spring when the regiment went into the field for a week's manoeuvres. This hike was most instructive and gave the men their first insight into actual field conditions, which eventually became so valuable to them. Colonel Pope returned to the commano, Major Cassidy was relieved, and the then Major Whipple was promoted to Lieut. Colonel and made second in command.
As summer drew on, rumors of the trip across became persistent. Replacements began to come in and the companies began to take on an appearance of completeness. Around the well trained troops was built an efficient organization and the stage was set fer an early departure.
It was not until the latter part of June, however, that definite orders were received that the division was to move. The advance party of officers to prepare the way in France, was then organized and went forward. On July 12 came definite orders to entrain for the port of embarkation during the early morning hours of July 14th. The regiment will long remember the leave taking. In darkness and absolute silence they left the camp, which had been their home for so long a time, entrained at the Q.M. siding and were off on the "Great Adventure."


Chapter II The Trip to France. By Major Elwin S. Warner.

So, with no cheering crowds, no weeping relatives, the regiment started on its first lap of the journey to the unknown and in an hour most of the men were asleep.
They rolled swiftly westward to the Connecticut, and then southerly to Springfield, Mass., there to be served with hot coffee by the Red Cross ladies who were the last American women the men were privileged to speak to for many weeks. After a short stop, where questions as to the identity and destination were answered cautiously by the remark,
"I don't
know," the train sped on its way to New York, with last glimpses of places familiar to many of the men.
Arrived at the terminal, boxes and baggage were hurriedly transferred from the train to the waiting ferry. The officers and men were hastily examined and, amid a few shouts from the children on shore, the
regiment ploughed across to the Bush terminal, where again they were hurried off the ferry, into the docks, served with coffee and buns and checked rapidly up the gang plank and down stairs into the bowels of the ship. While the men were adjusting themselves to their crowded and bitterly contested assignments of space, the ship's derricks were loading
barrack bags and baggage.
On the morning of the 15th of July the regiment found itself on board the Australian coaster "Katoomba" about to start, as it was, on its maiden trip across the Atlantic.
As the Statue 'of America's favorite lady slipped away in the distance many began to realize seriously, for the first time, that the Great Adventure had begun and, as in the midst of the convoy of fifteen ships, the yellow of the coastal currents changed to the blue of the deeper and rougher water, the attitude of the men changed, as the story goes, from being afraid they would die to a terrible premonition that they wouldn't, such was the upheaval of vital organs which they never suspected they possessed.
And then commenced the worst of the trip. The food was not of the best and those who could eat, contributed liberally to the rationing of the sea Dwellers. Men lost their equipment, missed their friends and finally discovered that the officers were making themselves more than ordinarily disagreeable by insisting that the floating garbage can be scrubbed from top to bottom. However, the disagreeable task was completed, and, as it insisted that a sunrise boat drill be held every day. Men were prone to throw themselves away in hidden places to sleep and the “G” note was often unheard and drills missed until some non-com. sought them out and hurried them on deck. But as in all things that the regiment undertakes, the drills became routine and as near perfect as sea-sick humanity can perfect anything.
After searching from the Equator to Iceland for a "sub", without success, the ship finally headed for an anchored off Liverpool, and Pittsburgh was as the fleece of Mary’s lamb, compared to the sooty atmosphere of the English port. Waiting on the deck was found an excellent boys' band, which played the repertoire of National airs, when again the regiment was rushed off the boat and led by a cocky "Bobby", in a Hooligan cap, the first contingent trudged faithfully to a station to get its first glimpse of and entrain in the box compartment of a funny but sturdy European railroad train. As the train crawled across Englano, past its well kept fields, between trim hedges and made its frequent stops near the neat red tiled or thatched roofs of some country town, the men first heard, with innocent and unselfish compliance, the whine of "gimme a penny" which they were destined to hear many times in other languages.
This interesting ride ended at a socalled Rest Camp (now graced in orders by the title of Embarkation Camp) at Winchester, where officers first bought their overseas caps and mussetles. A bath and shave was enjoyed and off went the regiment to Southampton, where it was mysteriously smuggled onto two boats and after dark swiftly slipped across that terror, the English Channel, to Le Havre, where the men piled off and were led to another Rest Camp through the narrow, dirty streets and past the disgusting urinals of our first French city.
Following another short intermission when many men and officers took the last real bath to be had for many weeks, the regiment entrained in those much advertised French wagons, stenciled "Hommes 40, Chevaux 8 (en long)." The long train rumbled easterly to Paris, almost, then making a detour to avoid the famous city, rolled slowly southward to the accompaniment of its shrieking engine whistle, which served as effectually in keeping the men awake, as a warning for unheeding France of our approach. At the end of this nerve racking journey, the Regiment was detrained and the troops led to camps near the station of St. Amand (Mont Rond) on the river Cher, in the waters of which the soot of the railroad was replaced by the sediment in the water ostensibly used for washing up.

Chapter III S. O. S. in the A. E. F. By Capt. Cedric Powers.

The 301 st Engineers arrived at St. Amand (Cher) at 7.00 P.M. July 31st, 1918, in a train of about 60 toy freight cars. It was the first experience in "Chevaux 8 or Hommes 40", and everyone was glad when the journey ended.
The Regiment camped for the night in "pup" tents on the bank of the river Cher and many took the opportunity the next morning for a dip.
Headquarters of the 76th Division was already established in St. Amand but as yet not working very smoothly. Finally the billetting officer, Lieut. Lachappelle, appeared ano the companies were located in small towns about three miles south of St. Amand as follows:
Headquarters - Drevant
"C" Company - Drevant
"F" Company - St. Georges
"E" Company - Poisieux
"D" Company - La Grotte
"B" Company - Columbier
"A" Company - Columbier
The majority of these towns were dirty so the first few days were spent in sweeping streets, cleaning billets, etc.
About this time word came that the 76th Division was turned into the 3rd Depot Division and that men would be trained and sent forward to combat organizations leaving simply a training cadre from the old organization to train the new contingents. The news caused a lot of dissatisfaction but the fears of this regiment proved to be unfounded as Colonel Pope upon his return from G. H. Q. announced that we would go to the front as Corps troops and operate as a unit.
Drevant was occupied by the Romans when they were running things and evidence of their occupation still exists in walls and an amphitheatre. The last was put to use on Sundays to stage athletic games, boxing bouts, vaudeville acts and band concerts by the "Iron Band" much to the amusement of the natives who came for miles to see the "Yanks".
One sight that will be remembered by all was that of the entire regiment standing at salute in this old Roman playground in France while the band played "The Star Spangled Banner".
To carry on the training of the division certain work had to be done and as this organization was supposed to know how to work, the regiment was ordered to build Q. M. storehouses and sidings, a classification camp at Orval and rifle, ranges at Chateauneuf, Uzay, La Celle and Chambon.

Before leaving the States every effort was made to complete the equipment of the regiment and when the freight went forward very few items were lacking and great was the dismay when the word came to St. Amand that our freight had been confiscated and pooled at Brest. By various means tools were finally obtained to undertake the work laio out and then steps were taken to get new engineer, quartermaster and ordnance equipment against the time when orders would come for the regiment to go up and do real work.
Lack of transportation was another difficulty we had to contend with but some of the companies practically solved this by hiring, at so many francs per hour, a turnout capable of holding five or six men drawn by a little mule about half as high as the wheels.
On August 15th the regiment paraded at Drevant and said goodbye to its first commanding Officer, Colonel F. A. Pope, who after being with it from its organization at Camp Devens was ordered to take command of the 315th Engineers of the 90th Division.
Finally orders came detaching the 301st Engineers from the 3rd Depot Division and assigning them as Corps Engineers to the 4th Army Corps in the Toul sector. "A" Company returned from its vacation at Chambon; "B" Company prepared to give up its city home at Orval and "D" Company, the survivor of the "Battles of La Grotte, La Celle, and Uzay", returned to St. Amand. The Headquarters Det. and "C" Company moved in from Drevant and
"F" Company forsook the castle which it had been occupying after "A" Company went to Chambon. "E" Company at Chateauneuf was on the line to Toul, so it prepared to join the regiment when it should pass thru on its way to that most begiroled city of Army Headquarters. Late in the afternoon of Sept. 9th, the 301st pulled out of St. Amand for Toul in two sections, travelling again in the toy cars marked "Cheveaux 8, Hommes 40".



Chapter IV The St. Mihiel Offensive and the Toul Sector. By Major Maurice H. Pease.

Arriving at Toul on the morning of September 11 we encountered a city of darkness and heard the distant boom of the guns. At Daybreak we marched to Bautzon Barracks.
Upon reporting to the Chief Engineer of the 4th Corps, the rumors of a contemplated offensive in the Toul sector were verified and it was whispered that the hour was near at hand.
That same night Companie "F" was sent to Ansauville to assist in putting in shape a forward Corps dump. The following morning the 1st Battalion was crowded into trucks and sent forward to Flirey and that afternoon "D" and "E" Companies followed and "F' Company moved forward.
The St. Mihiel offensive went over on the morning of September 12. The 1st Bn. arrived at noon, the 2nd Bn. the following morning and most of our effort was concentrated on the Flirey-Essey road. The men shovelled mud off the roads, threw stone on, pulled artillery through the mud and trucks, out of ditches and acted as traffic police. The French carts from C. I. X. No. 115 dumped spoonful after spoonful of rock while the Mack trucks, when not stuck in the mud, transferred the ruins of Flirey to the road across No-man's-land. By continous effort the road over Flirey hill was opened and kept open until, when relieved toward the end of the month, the road had a base and shoulders such that trucks would not dig themselves in. This was the first road opened to traffic and at all times the best road forward; as such it was much used and the traffic was one continual stream for several days.
The camp of the regiment was just north of Flirey and consisted of "pup" tents with 6 pyramidals for headquarters. These made an excellent target for enemey artillery, but it was known that they were using nothing but 3". One by one the companies were moved away from this conspicuous place and so when the Boche one day saw these tents flaunting in their faces and sent over a dozen or so 6" shells, there was nothing left except the Headquarters Detachment. After the first two shells, the men were far from camp and when one landed within a few feet of Headquarters kitchen it merely ridoled the neighboring tents, including the Colonel's, and punctured many kitchen utensils. Like tha Arabs, the Engineers moved in the night and the following day, Sept. 23rd, Headquarters was established at Bernecourt.
About this time, September 22nd, Colonel Pope, in command of the 315th Engineers of the 90th Division, on our right, cast envious eyes upon his old regiment and took the 2nd Bn. to construct a choice bit of road from Fey-en-Haye to Vilcey. Companies "D", "E" , anò "F" lived
For two weeks, informer German dugouts, becoming acquainted with a cootie and accustomed to having HE shells “bounce” off their dug out roof and to shrapnel breaking “50 feet away”. An excellent road emerged from the forest cart track.

commencing on 17 September, all companies became proficient in the art of moving. "A" and "C" Companies jumped from place to place, putting a few stones on the roads and scraping off a bit of mud until it became necessary on September 20th to construct some ammunition dumps. "A" Company constructed one in the Bois de Pannes and "C" Company one at Limey and later one at the Bois Rendu near the Flirey-Essey road. A slight interruption occurred. on September 24th when, on account of an expected offensive, both companies were recalled for road work.
During this period Company "B" became stabilized at St. Baussant, With the spasmodic help of "A" Company and a couple days help from
"D" and "E" Companies, (before their departure to help Col. Pope) Company "B". kept in passable shape the roads Seicheprey -St. Baussant-Essey, Seicheprey - Richecourt and St. Baussant - Richecourt.
About the 3rd of October, E Company transferred its attentions from the Fey - en - Haye. Vilcey road to the Limey - Remenauville - Euvezin road, and a few days after moved to the Bois de Four. On this job we acquired the 2nd Bn. of the 51 st Pioneers. A couple of days after, D and E Companies moved to palatial German shelters at historic Montsec and opened up the Seicheprey - Montsec and St. Baussant - Xivrey roads.
The next phase of work commenced on October 25th and consisted in 2nd position construction. "A" "B" "C" "D" and "F" Companies engaged in this work and milles of French high wire appeared stretching from the Bois de l'Etang to Mamey. It is hoped that the Boche prisoners who are rolling up this wire, have as adequate a supply of gloves as this regiment had when erecting same.
About November 1st Company "E" undertook to move Corps Headquarters from Boucq to Woinville - buildings and camouflage.
Shortly after midnight of the 9th of November came the announcement that the offensive so long rumored was to take place. Belongings were collected and packs hurriedly made in the dark. At 7 A.M. Companies “A”, "B", "C", and "E" with the first Bn. of the 51 st Pioneers gathered at their rendez-vous, Vigneulles, while "D" and "F" Companies with the 2nd Bn. of the 51st Pioneers collected at Thiaucourt. The orders were to follow the infantry over the top and repair roads. There commenced the famous. "St. Julier Offensive" when negro labor troops pichel woul chatop at a hill so near the enemy that, had the fog lifte, they would have made a beautiful target even for the Hun rifles. The infantry did not as a whole go over the top, but the order sending them over was expected at any moment. A day of waiting ensued followed by a night of discomfort.
On the morning of the eleventh, at 6 A.M., word came over the wire that the armistice had been signed to become effective at 11 A.M.
The artillery turned loose and fired until the last second.
Thus ended the war and then occurred the resumption of close order drill and camp fires.
In the interim following the 11th of November, Company "D" repaired the masonry arch bridge on the Xammes-Charey road, which had suffered several direct hits, and so preparted the way for the 3rd Division to proceed in its march of occupation.
During this period the Regiment suffered 27 casualties. Three of these resulted in deaths. (These figures do not include men sent to hospital on account of sickness.)



Chapter V The March Into Germany. By Capt. Arthur L. Shaw.

When the Armistice went into effect on the 11th hour of the 11 th day of the 11th month and put to an end the carnage and savage fighting of the "Battle of St. Julien", that whirlwind finish of the "Operations between Meuse and Moselle", the regiment caught its breath and found that just five days were allotted in which to complete and renew its equipment and get into shape to advance as a part of the Army of Occupation. For those five strenuous days bales of clothing, heaps of tools and hordes of wiero-looking fleabitten creatures (which later under the expert care of our stable sergeants and wagoners became recognizable as horses and mules) deluged the outfit. 
On 17 November, marching as Corps Engineers under Field Orders 66, Hq. Fourth Corps, the various units of the regiment took the road, with epuipment in all essentials complete. The orders of the line companies required them to assist Divisional Engineers in the task of making the axial roads passable across the German lines. It was necessary for these companies to march a good part of the night of the 16th in order to reach the appointed places in time to undertake their allotted tasks punctually, but in spite of the fatigue of night hiking, so expeditiously was the work accomplished that all roads were declared passable, and the companies relieved, early in the forenoon of the 17th. Then began the movement northward, companies converging on the axial roads assigned for the advance of Corps troops.

Due to the thoroughness of the American Artillery Ouring the weeks prior to the Armistice, and to the destructive effect of the heavy traffic of the retreating Germans, the roads found on the 17th and 18th offered great difficulties to the trains both motor and horsedrawn. The animals were nearly all freshly discharged from veterinary hospitals and were weak, soft and unaccustomed to working together. Skillful handling and the assistance of men pulling on ropes through the worst mud holes overcame all difficulties, however, and two days rest at Ozerailles and Fleville. on 19 and 20 November put all animals into shape to continue the march over the excellent roads which were thereafter encountered.
Through villages bedecked with evergreen garlands and bright with the tricolor and the "Stars and Stripes", the march continued, while crisp
cold days with cloudless skies belied the usual tales of European winter, In northern France, burdened by German occupation for four long years, the remaining civilians were almost hysterical with joy and gratitude for their delivery and told with flashing eyes of German selfishness and theft, Crossing into Lorraine between Trieux and Lommeringen on 21 November, a gradual but subtly sure change could be noticed in the attitude of the people. Still the tricolor and the garlands, but here among the roadside throngs, increasingly evident as France was left farther and farther in the rear, was the aloof, phlegmatic person who dully watched and puffed his pipe but did not smile or cheer. This was the outward effect of forty odd years of German domination in this fair land which France has never owned to be rightfully German, infiltration of German colonists having created a population mixed in both race and sentiment.
In Lommeringen, the first village in Lorraine, the regiment was met by a delegation of leading citizens, and a brief halt was made while the village priest delievered an address of welcome to the Americans, presenting the Commanding Officer and his staff with flowers in great profusion.
Lt. Colonel Whipple made reply on behalf of the regiment and the march was resumed, the regiment being escorted for several kilometers by flower bedecked young people carrying flags of the United States and of France.

On 23 November the independent Grand Duchy of Luxembourg was entered between Ewringen and Frisange, meeting with apparently no resentment, tho the people were obviously not over-enthusiastic at the occupation of their tiny country by American troops.
Arriving at Bous, that village and adjacent "dorfs" geographically a part of Bous, became the abiding place of the regiment until 2 December, while the Army awaited the appointed time for entry onto German soil. Here the fine weather ended,
and with the dull wet weather the first and only serious misfortune befell the regiment when an epidemic of Spanish Influenza broke out, principally in "A" Company which had many cases, its ranks being badly thinned by the evacuation of the more severe cases to the hospitals.
Resuming the march on 2 December, the course followed the valley of the beautiful Moselle River and a crossing into Germany was effected over the bridge at Gravenmacher, It was a memorable occasion when, with band playing and Colors flying, the column tramped into Germany.

Trier was entered with much curiosity, as it furnished the first opportunity for the regiment to see a German town of any size. days in the "suburb", known jas Olewig, gave opportunity, for direct observation of a city population, of the war's effect on it and of its attitude and thought, which interested all ranks, perhaps more than dio the Roman ruins and other objects of historical interest with which Trier abounds.
The regiment having been detailed to guard the (railroad from Ruwer- Paulin to Coblenz (by way of Simmern) "E" and "F" Companies marched out of Olewig on 6 December, the latter to guard from Ruwer-Paulin to Reinsfeld and the former from Reinsfeld to Morbach. Five days later, 11 December, the American lines having advanced,
"A" Company took over the railroad from Morbach to Kastellaun, and "B" Company from Kastellaun to Ehr. The following day, 12 December, "D" Company established guards from Ehr to Bopparo and "C" Company, from Bopparo to Coblenz, Regimental Headquarters being semi-permanently established at Bopparo, a famous watering place on the Rhine. A change in the plans of the Allied Commander- in - Chief, necessitating the removal of all American troops to the left bank of the Moselle, headquarters was moved to Brohl, leaving Bopparo 17 December and arriving at Brohl 18 December
"A", "B", "C", and "D" Companies were relieved of R. R. guard duty on 14 December - "F" Company on 16 December and "E" Company on 23 December.
In the meantime, a ponton bridge, of German equipment had been built across the Moselle between Treis and Carden to facilitate the move. ment of American troops. It became apparent that the efficient operation and maintenance of this bridge, which had to be opened once each day to permit river traffic to pass, required the services of Engineer troops and on 14 December one platoon of "C" Company was detailed to this work.
The next day the entire company was sent to Carden, as the rapidly rising river and the heavy traffic made a larger force necessary to maintain the brioge. Later on 28 December, "A" Company relieved "C" Company, the latter rejoining the regiment at Brohl.

As Brohl gave every indication of being a semi-permanent headquarters, a rifle range was built and a delousing plant constructed, measures being taken to provide warm mess halls for all units and shelters for animals. A welfare hall was provided where reading matter and writing material was always on hand and where, whenever possible, smoking materials and confections were on sale. Drill schedules were aopted and schools for officers and non-commissioned officers established.

Thus, the New Year of 1919 found the regiment at the end of a march of 328 kilometers covered between the dates of 17 November and
18 December. Of these 52 days, only 14 were spent in marching, making the average day's march for the regiment 23½ kilometers. The longest day's march was on 11 December, from Simmern to Boppard - 36 kilometers — and this came on the last day of the five day's continuous march from Olewig to Boppard - 131 kilometers. After such an experience, it is not surprising that "Whipple's Circus" makes light work of stowing its kits on short nofice or in the dark and making ready for the road.



Chapter VI With the Army of Occupation. By Lt. Chas. J. Lawson.

Just before noon on the 18th of December the 301st, Engineers entered the area which had been or less vague task of "occupation." The center of the area and the headquarters of the regiment was Brohl, a fair sized manufacturing town of some 2,000 inhabitants. The city itself could scarcely be termed beautiful. In fact it was somewhat squalio and dirty before the arrival of the Americans who issued an order through the Burgomaster for the policing of the streets and disposal of all refuse. But situated as if is close against the the hills on one bank of what has been termed the most beaufiful river in the world and overlooking the river itself, the majestic hills covered with vineyards and studded occasionally with the ruins of feudal castles, it has appealed to the majority as not sudi a bad place for Europe. And it was particularly welcome to those footsore aud weary troops because it was to be the final destination of the regiment after 328 kilometers of hiking.

The first consideration, here as elsewhere at the temporary stopping places was the housing of the companies. So, while the men were lining up behind their kitchens for the noon-day meal of beef-stew and coffee, the billeting officers and non-commisioned officers were at work apportioning the billets among the companies and registering them for the maximum number of men. This done, it was not long before the men were in the houses arranging themselves as comfortably as could be expected under the crowded conditions which at first existed. But as time wore on, more billets were found and requisitioned and conditions grew better.

Probably one of the most interesting of the billets assigned at that time was the one given the officers of Company "B". This was an old
castle dating back several centuries, through recently renovated and provided with additional wings. It was situated upon the side of the hill overlooking Brchl, which commanding position afforded an excellent view up and down the river valley. The view, however, was not all of the interest that the castle held for its occupants from the new world, for it boasted a tiny chapel and an immense baronial hall, turrets and stained glass windows and among its interior decorations, suits of armor, battle axes and other warlike appendages.
It was not long before the regiment adjusted itself to its new, strangely settled life. All animals were properly stabled, the rolling kitchens were housed, shelves and store rooms were provided and last but not least, for the first time since the regiment's departure from Camp Devens, nearly six months before, the men were provided with messhalls and tables, heretofore an almost unheard of arrangement in the A. E. F. Headquarters had been established in a large and well adapted build g in the center of the town, and the regimental colors were placed in their righiful place at the front of the building where the ex - Kaiser's former vassals could wonder at their beauty and marvel at the respect and devotion which the men of the regiment showed them.

One of the most welcome advantages of the new garrison life was the Regimental Delouser, construction of which was commenced shortly atter the arrival of the regiment. Needless to say, it was popular from the start and casualties in the Cootie tribe were heavy. At last reports the species had been practically exterminated due to the efficiency of the etablishment and it was though that it had worked itself out of a job, until its great popularity as a bathing resort became noticeable.
Christmas was a day that the majority looked forward to with dread but it turned out to be not quite so bad as they had feared, for "9X3X4's" arrived from home, and the regimental celebration helped the day along.

On Christmas Eve the companies were formed and marched by their First Sergeants to the flats near the river, where a table for each company was set with gifts of chocolade, cigarettes, gum and other articles for each man.  These were given out by harrassed Supply Sergeants, and the companies then broke and formed before the stage on which three human reprouctions of Saint Nicholes smiled benevolently on the audience. Christmas trees, decorated with tinsel and electric lights flanked the stage and beneath one of these the regimental band rendered tunes to which the crowd sang. Their songs turned to cheers and then silence, however, when four real American women, in the uniform of the Army Nurse Corps, appeared and sang several Christmas songs which met with stentorian approval. The commanding Officer then spoke briefly to the regiment, and after a snake dance which spoke well for the spirits of the men, the crowd windled and except for the holiday on the following day, another Christmas drifted by into the past.

Soon after Christmas the Staff Officers of the regiment transferred their belongings and their mess which had heretofore held forth in Hotel Mittler to a very beautiful, though comparatively modern castle on the extreme southern edge of the town. Situated high on the hills as it was, one could see from its terraced lawns, magnificent views of the Rhine as it threaded its way from above the famous Namedy Sprudel, until it round-ed, in one of its many curves, below the town of Linz. This place was the property and summer home of Herr Eickhoff, who had given it the name of Alkburg. The property was at that time untenanted except by the caretaker and his wife, whom the officers of the staff dubbed "Frau Immer Arbeiten". These people occupied the gate lodge below the castle so the the castle itself became the exclusive property of the Americans and the Stars and Stripes drifted lazily in the breezes which rippled the waters of Germany's most majestic river far below.
Things soon took on a more settled aspect in Brohl. Regimental Retreat and parades and Formal Guard Mounts were held nearly every day on the flats near the river, and were a source of great interest to the population, as well as of pride to the men of the regiment. Two companies, "A", and "E", were detached from the regiment and put on special work with the Third Army in Coblenz, and one was kept on duty at the pontoon bridge at Treis on the Moselle River for a regular period and was then relieved by another company from Brohl.
Among the most notable achievements within the regiment during this period of its history, was the organization of the A. E. F. club, under the direction of Chaplain Simonds, the regimental padre, and the Misses Sweeny who were latter relieved by Miss Yarrington and Miss Barksdale, in order that the former might return to the States after eighteen months of service with the American first line troops. Great credit is due to these two Virginia gentlewomen, who in the short time that they were with us found places in the hearts of every members of the regiment by their unselfish devotion to the needs of their countrymen.

Entertainments, varying from "movies" to Musical Comedies were provided at the hall each night, and the packed hall gave sufficient evidence of their popularity. On Sunday afternoons, the Misses Sweeny and later, Miss Barksale and Miss Varrington, served such delicacies as cakes, pie, ice cream and chocolate to the men and officers and Sunday afternoon became a time of the week to look foward to.

Numerous attempts were made by all in authority to help us forget that gnawing hunger for home and home folk, and though none of them quite accomplished the desired end, all of them helped us by affording diversion from the routine work involved in the business of "Occupying." Among these were the twelve hour trips to Coblenz which were afforded each man. Details went by companies and were transported by truck.
Upon arriving in town, they were given tickets entitling them to restaurant meals free of charge, and were directed to the varivous places of interest about the town. At ten o'clock in the evening the men reported back to their trucks and were rolled over the road to Brohl.

Another method was the boat tríp up or down the river in German river steamers. The regiment was assigned one steamer for three days, and two companies were taken upon the trip at one time. The men were transported to Andernach, where the steamer docked, by truck, and returned
10 Brohl in the same manner, when the voyage was completed. Two meals were provide on board the boat and the regimental band kept spirits up and "viel zu essen" down, for as a rule they were given a separate table and as much as they could eat as reward for their labors.

About the first of February, the organization of the Post Schools was undertaken under orders from General Headquarters. Chaplain Simonds was placed in charge, but their constant growth threatened to endanger his other duties, and Captain Waldron took over the director ship. Courses in all of the elementary Grammar School and High School subjects were introduced as well as professional courses in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Automobile Repairing, etc. Instructors were drawn from competent officers and men of the regiment and all of the courses became very popular.
During the middle of march, word reached us that our success in the organization of the Post Schools, had led to a decision on the part of the Corps Commander to establish a Corps School in Vocational Subjects at Brohl, under the direction of Lt. Colonel Whipple. Captain Waldron was named Executive Officer and the work of constructing suitable housing and messing arrangements to accomodate the students was commenced.
Four barracks and a kitchen and mess hall were planned, and on March 28, ground was broken for these buildings on the flats near the river. days later the buildings were sufficiently completed for the housing and messing of the three hundred students, and only a small amount of interior work remained.

Somewhat earlier in the month, word came that the regiment would be inspected and reviewed by General Pershing, together with the remainder of the core troops at Kaiseresch, and Dame Rumor immediately set her twisted tongue to wagging with the news that we were to return home shortly after the inspection. But the inspection came, and we stood in deep snow while our ears, hand and noses came near freezing, and listened intently to the short speech of the Commander-in-Chief after he had inspectend us, hoping that he would give us some hint of our fate.
But none came and we returned to Brohl to take up our routine of work once more, while the inspection faded into the past, and Dame Rumor acknowledging herself once more in the wrong. However, it was no lesson to her for she still wags her twisted tongue while we wait and wait for the time when her tales will prove true, and we will start for home. But we venture to believe that when that time comes, the shock of finding that her own fanciful inventions have for once come true, will be too much for the old lady and that Dame Rumor will fall into a long trance until the next war calls her back into being.
