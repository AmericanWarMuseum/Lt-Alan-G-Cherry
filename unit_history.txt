A SHORT HISTORY OF THE 301ST ENGINEERS.

Chapter I Camp Devens

The officers of the 301st Engineers recalled their excitement when first assigned and their bittersweet departure from Boston in August 1917. The regiment officially formed on September 1, 1917, under Colonel Francis A. Pope, with officers and enlisted men gradually arriving. By early November, the regiment was nearly at full strength, receiving its first horses and mules, leading to notorious “bronco-busting” exercises.
At Camp Devens, training intensified despite harsh winter conditions, with men drilling, constructing trenches, and learning engineering tasks. In December, the regiment was reviewed in Providence, Rhode Island, and soon took on training responsibilities for the 14th Railway Engineers, who left for France within a month. However, by Christmas, many trained men were reassigned to other units, leaving gaps that the regiment worked hard to fill.
As spring approached, activities shifted to competitive drills, bridge-building, and field exercises. The regiment received its colors and focused on athletics, with field days, ball games, and outdoor sports becoming part of daily life. A week-long field maneuver provided valuable insight into real-world conditions.
By summer, rumors of deployment grew. Replacements arrived, completing the regiment’s ranks. In late June, orders confirmed their movement to France. On July 14, 1918, in darkness and silence, the regiment departed Camp Devens for the port of embarkation, embarking on their “Great Adventure.”

Chapter II The Trip to France

The regiment began its journey quietly, with no cheering crowds or farewells. After a brief stop in Springfield, Massachusetts, where Red Cross ladies served coffee, they continued to New York, transferring to a ferry bound for Bush Terminal. There, they boarded the Australian coaster Katoomba on July 15, 1918, for its maiden Atlantic crossing.
As the Statue of Liberty faded from view, the men realized their Great Adventure had begun. Seasickness soon struck, shifting their fears from dying to dreading survival. The food was poor, equipment was lost, and officers enforced strict cleanliness. Daily boat drills became routine despite the men’s attempts to evade them.
After an uneventful search for submarines, the ship reached Liverpool, where a boys' band welcomed them. The regiment marched through the soot-covered port, led by a cocky "Bobby," and boarded a European train. The journey through England’s tidy countryside introduced them to the persistent plea of "gimme a penny."
The regiment arrived at a rest camp in Winchester, where officers bought their overseas caps before continuing to Southampton. Under cover of night, they crossed the English Channel to Le Havre, encountering narrow, dirty streets and public urinals in their first French city.
After a brief rest, they boarded French boxcars labeled "Hommes 40, Chevaux 8" for a grueling ride south, bypassing Paris. They finally arrived at St. Amand, settling near the river Cher to clean off the journey’s soot in its murky waters.

Chapter III S. O. S. in the A. E. F. 

The 301st Engineers arrived at St. Amand (Cher) on July 31, 1918, after a cramped journey in "Chevaux 8, Hommes 40" freight cars. Camping along the river Cher that night, many enjoyed a morning swim before settling in. The regiment's E Company was assigned to the nearby village of Poisieux, which was dirty and required initial cleanup efforts.
Despite thorough preparations before leaving the U.S., the regiment’s freight was confiscated and pooled at Brest, causing delays in securing equipment. The men improvised, obtaining tools and hiring mule carts for transportation.
On August 15, the regiment paraded at Drevant to bid farewell to its first commanding officer, Colonel F.A. Pope, who left to command the 315th Engineers. Soon after, orders came assigning the 301st Engineers as Corps Engineers for the 4th Army Corps in the Toul sector.
E Company, stationed at Châteauneuf, prepared to reunite with the regiment on its way to Toul. On September 9, the 301st left St. Amand in two sections, once again traveling in the familiar "Chevaux 8, Hommes 40" cars.

Chapter IV The St. Mihiel Offensive and the Toul Sector. 

Arriving in Toul on September 11, the regiment encountered a city in darkness and the distant boom of artillery. By dawn, they marched to Bautzen Barracks and confirmed rumors of an impending offensive. The next morning, the 1st Battalion moved forward to Flirey, followed by D, E, and F Companies.
The St. Mihiel Offensive launched on September 12. The regiment’s focus was on the Flirey-Essey road, where men shoveled mud, reinforced roads, and pulled artillery and trucks from ditches. Continuous effort kept the road open, making it the best forward route, with constant traffic for days. The regiment camped near Flirey in vulnerable "pup" tents, eventually relocating after enemy shells riddled the camp.
On September 22, the 2nd Battalion was loaned to the 315th Engineers to construct a road from Fey-en-Haye to Vilcey. Living in former German dugouts, they endured shellfire while transforming forest tracks into solid roads. By early October, attention shifted to new roads near Limey, Remenauville, and Montsec. D and E Companies moved to German shelters at Montsec and continued road work in the area.
In early November, E Company helped relocate Corps Headquarters from Boucq to Woinville. On November 9, orders came for the regiment to follow the infantry and repair roads during the anticipated offensive. At Vigneulles, they waited near enemy lines, enduring discomfort while ready to advance.
On November 11, word arrived at 6 A.M. that the armistice would take effect at 11 A.M. The artillery fired until the last moment, marking the war's end. The regiment resumed drills and camp duties, having suffered 27 casualties, including three deaths.



Chapter V The March Into Germany. 

When the Armistice took effect on November 11, the 301st Engineers had just five days to replenish equipment and prepare for their role in the Army of Occupation. On November 17, they marched as Corps Engineers, repairing roads through former German lines despite mud, artillery damage, and weak animals. By November 18, the roads were passable, and the regiment advanced north.
Passing through villages adorned with garlands and flags, they were warmly welcomed by liberated civilians in France. Upon entering Lorraine on November 21, the atmosphere shifted to one of reserve due to decades of German rule. In Lommeringen, local leaders greeted the regiment, and villagers escorted them with flowers and flags.
On November 23, the regiment entered Luxembourg, where locals appeared indifferent to their presence. They stayed in Bous until December 2, enduring an influenza outbreak that primarily affected Company A. Resuming the march along the Moselle River, they crossed into Germany at Gravenmacher with band playing and Colors flying.
The regiment arrived in Trier, their first large German town, and observed the local population more intently than the historic ruins. Headquarters moved to Brohl on December 18, where a rifle range, delousing plant, and warm mess halls were built. Welfare facilities provided reading materials, writing supplies, and smoking items for the troops.
By January 1919, the regiment had completed a 328-kilometer march from November 17 to December 18, spending 14 days on the road with an average march of 23.5 kilometers per day. The longest stretch, from Simmern to Boppard on December 11, covered 36 kilometers. After this journey, “Whipple’s Circus” became adept at packing up and marching on short notice, ready for whatever lay ahead.

Chapter VI With the Army of Occupation
On December 18, 1918, the 301st Engineers reached Brohl, Germany, marking the end of their 328-kilometer march. Brohl, a modest manufacturing town on the scenic Rhine River, became their semi-permanent headquarters. Upon arrival, the regiment focused on billeting the troops, cleaning the town, and establishing mess halls for the first time since leaving Camp Devens. The regimental colors were prominently displayed, and the soldiers settled into garrison life, building a rifle range, a delousing plant, and welfare facilities.
Christmas in Brohl was more festive than expected. Each company received gifts of chocolate, cigarettes, and gum, distributed at a celebration with music, decorated trees, and performances by Army nurses, whose presence lifted spirits. Soon after, the staff officers moved into a castle overlooking the Rhine, flying the Stars and Stripes from its terraces.
Life in Brohl included parades, drills, and guard duties. Companies were periodically detached for special assignments in Coblenz and Treis. The regiment organized an A.E.F. club with entertainment, movies, and social gatherings led by Chaplain Simonds and the dedicated Misses Sweeney, Yarrington, and Barksdale, who became beloved by the troops.
Efforts to boost morale included trips to Coblenz and boat rides along the Rhine, with meals provided and music from the regimental band. Post schools were established in February, offering courses in subjects ranging from grammar to vocational training. The success of these schools led to the creation of a Corps School in Brohl under Lt. Colonel Whipple, with new barracks and facilities built to accommodate students.
In March, the regiment was inspected by General Pershing at Kaisersesch. Soldiers endured freezing temperatures, hoping for news of their return home, but none came. The inspection passed, and routine life resumed in Brohl, with soldiers continuing their work and waiting patiently for orders to return to the U.S., while rumors of their departure swirled.
